## Mithral
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral Chain Shirt or Breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.

|Type of Mithral Item|Item Cost Modifier|
|--- |--- |
|Light armor|+1,000 gp|
|Medium armor|+4,000 gp|
|Heavy armor|+9,000 gp|
|Shield|+1,000 gp|
|Other items|+500 gp/lb.|


## Adamantine
*Hardness 20, HP 40 per inch of thickness*
Adamantine is a rare and extremely durable metal. Crafting from it requires extreme precision and skill. Naturally occurring adamantine is mostly found in meteorites and rare mineral veins.This ultrahard metal adds to the quality of a weapon or suit of armor. Weapons fashioned from adamantine have a natural ability to bypass hardness when sundering weapons or attacking objects, ignoring hardness less than 20.  While wearing a suit of adamantine armor, any critical hit against the wearer becomes a normal hit. 

Only weapons, armor, and shields normally made of metal can be fashioned from adamantine. Weapons, armor and shields normally made of steel that are made of adamantine have one-third more hit points than normal. Adamantine has 40 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 20.

|Type of Adamantine Item|Item Cost Modifier|
|--- |--- |
|Ammunition|+60 gp|
|Light armor|+5,000 gp|
|Medium armor|+10,000 gp|
|Heavy armor|+15,000 gp|
|Weapon|+3,000 gp|
|Shield|+2,000 gp|


## Darkwood
*Hardness 5, HP 10 per inch of thickness*
This rare magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from darkwood  weighs only half as much as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being made of darkwood. To determine the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.

## Dragonhide
*Hardness 10, HP 5 per inch of thickness*
Armorsmiths can work with the hides of dragons to produce armor or shields of masterwork quality. One dragon produces enough hide for a single suit of masterwork hide armor for a creature one size category smaller than the dragon. By selecting only choice scales and bits of hide, an armorsmith can produce one suit of masterwork banded mail for a creature two sizes smaller, one suit of masterwork half-plate for a creature three sizes smaller, or one masterwork breastplate or suit of full plate for a creature four sizes smaller. In each case, enough hide is available to produce a small or large masterwork shield in addition to the armor, provided that the dragon is Large or larger.

Because dragonhide armor isn’t made of metal, druids can wear it without penalty. Dragonhide armor costs double what armor of that type ordinarily costs, but it takes no longer to make than ordinary armor of that type.

## Iron, Cold
*Hardness 10, HP 30 per inch of thickness*
This iron, mined deep underground, known for its effectiveness against fey creatures, is forged at a lower temperature to preserve its delicate properties. Weapons made of cold iron cost twice as much to make as their normal counterparts. Also, any magical enhancements cost an additional 2,000 gp.

Items without metal parts cannot be made from cold iron. An arrow could be made of cold iron, but a quarterstaff could not. 

A melee weapon or piece of ammunition made of cold iron deals 1d6 extra damage against fey, and any damage dealt with it against a fey or a creature with fey ancestry reduces the target's hit point maximum by the amount of damage dealt. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.

Fey have disadvantage on attacks made against a creature wearing armor made out of cold iron.

A fey or a creature with fey ancestry is considered poisoned for the duration of holding an object made of cold iron or wearing armor made of cold iron, this effect ignoring immunity to the poisoned condition.

## Silver, Alchemical
*Hardness 8, HP 10 per inch of thickness*
A complex process involving metallurgy and alchemy can bond silver to a weapon made of steel so that it bypasses the damage reduction of creatures such as lycanthropes. On a successful attack with a silvered weapon, the wielder takes a -1 penalty on the damage roll (with the usual minimum of 1 point of damage)The alchemical silvering process can’t be applied to nonmetal items, and it doesn’t work on rare metals such as adamantine, cold iron, and mithral.
