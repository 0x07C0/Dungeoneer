For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on Ability Checks.\n\n\n\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\n\n\n\nFinishing a Long Rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink."
