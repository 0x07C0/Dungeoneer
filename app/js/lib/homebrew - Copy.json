Only after the heartbreaak of witnessing STrahd himself slay Vladimir's beloved, his fellow knight Sir Godfrey Gwilym. With the battle won, Strahd surrounded Argynvost. Rather than cower in his lair, Argynvost emerged and battled Strahd's armies to the bitter end. <br><br><strong>Deadly vengeance: </strong> Unwilling to accept his failure, Vladimir return ed as a revenant. So great was his hatred of STrahd and his thirst for vengeance that those feelings fueled the spirits of many of his fellow knights - including Godfrey - to come back as revenants as well. Vladimir continued to wage the hopeless war, even as Strahd tightened his grip on the valley. ",

The two story building leanes haphazardly on one side, and the sign, which depicts an octagon inscribed with Draconic runes (They translate to Shop), is heavily faded. \n\nZaru's shop was a quaint little magic shop, which sold mundane equipment, the occasional barrel of salted pork and uncommon magic items.\n\nBy a dark twist of fate, Zaru was turned into a vampire spawn, his inherent sorcerous ability twisted into a vicious form of telekinetic ability.\n\nUnwilling to leave his shop despite his ever present hunger, Zaru will trade his items for fresh humanoid blood. His rates are approximitely 10 gp per liter of blood, but do depend on his mood. Thus a torch would generally cost a little suckle, whilst a potion of healing would demand a price which would drain one human dead. \n\nZaru will also trade items from the players for half their market value in the form of other items. He does not accept gold, generally his rule is : \"IF I can't suckle it I don't want it.\"\n\nZaru is quite mad. He may begin randomly throwing things at visitors. He keeps his shop pristine, but will, if the mood strikes him, hurl projectiles via his Catapult spell at customers.",
